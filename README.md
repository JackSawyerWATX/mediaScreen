## Project Description: Home Office Setup Layout

This project demonstrates a responsive layout for a small web setup, consisting of a main content area and a sidebar. The layout is designed with mobile-first principles, starting with a single-column design for smaller screens and adapting to a two-column layout on larger devices.

    - The main content section provides tips for home office setup.
    - The sidebar section offers links to additional articles related to the topic.

The layout utilizes CSS media queries to adjust the design for devices with screen widths of at least 600px, optimizing the user experience on both mobile and desktop screens.

## Files
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the layout.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS for styling the elements and making the layout responsive.

## How It Works
1. On smaller screens (default view), the elements take up 100% width, stacked vertically.
2. For screens smaller than 600px, the elements are displayed side-by-side, each taking up less width with a small margin between them.

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in your browser to see the responsive layout in action.
